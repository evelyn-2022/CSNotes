# Web Design

## Page Sizes

Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around **960-1000 pixels wide** (since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens). Designers assumed that users would see the top **570-600 pixels** of a page without having to scroll and some tried to fit all of the key messages in this area. The area of the page that users would see without scrolling was often referred as being “above the fold”.

This grid is called the **960 pixel grid** and is widely used by web designers. These two pages illustrate a **960 pixel wide, 12 column grid**. They demonstrate how it is possible to create a wide range of column layouts using this one grid. The page is 960 pixels wide and there are 12 equal sized columns (shown in gray), each of which is 60 pixels wide. Each column has a margin set to 10 pixels, which creates a gap of 20 pixels between each column and 10 pixels to the left and right-hand sides of the page. (available at https://960.gs/)

## Site Maps

The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This is known as a **site map** and it will show how those pages can be grouped.

To help you decide what information should go on each page, you can use a technique called **card sorting**. This involves placing each piece of information that a visitor might need to know on a separate piece of paper and then organizing the related information into groups.

## Wireframes

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

You should not include the color scheme, font choices, backgrounds or images for the website in the wireframe. It should focus on what information needs to be on each page and create a visual hierarchy to indicate the most important parts of each page. The wireframes make design easier because you know what information needs to appear on which page before considering how the the page should look.
