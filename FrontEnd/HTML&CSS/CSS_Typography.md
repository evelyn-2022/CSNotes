# CSS: Typography

## Changing Font Properties

### Font Family

The `font-family` property is used to declare which font—as well as which fallback or substitute fonts—should be used to display text. The first declared font, starting from the left, is the primary font choice. Should the first font be unavailable, alternative fonts are declared after it in order of preference from left to right.
Font names consisting of two or more words need to be wrapped in quotation marks. Additionally, **the last font should be a keyword value**, which will use the system default font for the specified type, most commonly either _sans-serif_ or _serif_.

```css
body {
	font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
 }
```

### Using Web-Safe Fonts

By default there are a few fonts that are pre-installed on every computer, tablet, smartphone, or other web-browsing-capable device. These fonts have become known as “web-safe fonts.”

#### Embedding Web Fonts

We can also specify non-standard, custom web fonts for use on our website via the CSS **@font-face** at-rule. First, we use the **@font-face** at-rule to identify our font’s name, via the `font-family` property, as well as the source of our font (the path to the font file containing our chosen font), via the `src` property. From there we are able to use this font by including its name within any font-family property value.

```css
@font-face {
	font-family: "Lobster";
	src: local("Lobster"), url("lobster.woff") format("woff");
}
body {
	font-family: "Lobster", "Comic Sans", cursive;
}
```

If the `local()` function is provided, specifying a font name to look for on the user's computer, and the user agent finds a match, that local font is used. Otherwise, the font resource specified using the `url()` function is downloaded and used.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a free library of web fonts that you can use in your CSS by referencing the font's URL. We can also add the link generated by Google Fonts to our HTML header as stylesheet.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:100,300,400">
```

#### Font Format

Different browsers support different formats for fonts (in the same way that they support different audio and video formats), so you will need to supply the font in several variations to reach all browsers.

The various font formats should appear in your code in this order:

1. eot
2. woff
3. ttf/otf
4. svg

If you do not have all of these formats for your font, you can upload the font to a website called FontSquirrel where they will convert it for you:
https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator.
It also provides you with the CSS code for the @font-face rule.

### Font Size

The `font-size` property provides the ability to set the size of text using common length values, including pixels, em units, percentages, points, or font-size keywords.

### Font Style

To change text to italics, or to prevent text from being italicized, we’ll use the `font-style` property. The `font-style` property accepts four keyword values: **_normal_**, **_italic_**, **_oblique_**, and **_inherit_** (Italic fonts were traditionally stylized versions of the font based on calligraphy, whereas an oblique version would take the normal version and put it on an angle).

### Font Variant

The `font-variant` property accepts three values: _normal_, _small-caps_, and _inherit_.

### Font Weight

The `font-weight` property accepts either keyword or numeric values. Keyword values include _normal_, _bold_, _bolder_, _lighter_, and _inherit_.

The numeric values 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900 pertain specifically to typefaces that have multiple weights. The order of these weights starts with the thinnest weight, 100, and scales up to the thickest weight, 900. For reference, <em><u>the keyword value of **normal** maps to 400 and the keyword **bold** maps to 700</em></u>; thus, any numeric value below 400 will be fairly thin, and any value above 700 will be fairly thick.

==Note:==
Before using a numeric value, we need to check and see whether the typeface we are using comes in the weight we’d like to use.
For example, the Times New Roman typeface comes in two weights: normal, or 400, and bold, or 700. Attempting to use a weight of 900 will default the typeface to the closest related weight, 700 in this case.

### Line Height

**Leading** (pronounced ledding) is a term typographers use for the vertical space between lines of text. In a typeface, the part of a letter that drops beneath the baseline is called a descender, while the highest point of a letter is called the ascender. **Leading is measured from the bottom of the descender on one line to the top of the ascender on the next.**
<img src="https://s2.loli.net/2021/12/17/FWTw5Kbltn9NkiA.png" >

In CSS, the `line-height` property sets the height of an entire line of text, so the
difference between the fontsize and the line-height is equivalent to the leading.
<img src="https://s2.loli.net/2021/12/17/35EN9ocpxI1JjDH.png" width='360'>

`line height` property declares the distance between two lines of text (often referred to as leading). The line-height property accepts all general length values.
The best practice for legibility is to set the line-height to around **one and a half times our font-size property value**. This could be quickly accomplished by setting the lineheight to 150%, or just 1.5 or 1.5em.

Line height may also be used to vertically center a single line of text within an element. **Using the same property value for the line-height and height properties will vertically center the text**:

```
 .btn {
 height: 22px;
 line-height: 22px;
 }
```

This technique may be seen with buttons, alert messages, and other single-line text blocks.

==Note:== to adjust the cursor of buttons, `cursor: pointer;`

### Shorthand Font Properties

The `font` property can accept multiple font-based property values. The order of these property values should be as follows, from left to right: **_font-style, font-variant, font-weight, font-size, line-height, and font-family._** These property values are listed from left to right without the use of commas (except for font names, as the font-family property value uses commas). _A forward slash, /, separator is needed between the font-size and line-height property values_.

When using this shorthand value, every property value is optional **except the _font-size_ and _font-family_ property values**.

```
p {
 font: italic small-caps bold 14px/22px "Helvetica Neue",
 Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
 }
```

## Changing Text Properties

### Text Align

The `text-align` property has five values: **\*left**, **right**, **center**, **justify**, and **inherit\***. The text-align property is inherited by child elements.

### Vertical Align

The vertical-align property is a common source of confusion. It is not intended to allow you to vertically align text in the middle of block level elements such as `<p>` and `<div>`. <u><i>It only applies to inline, inline-block and table-cell elements: you can't use it to vertically align block-level elements.</i></u>

The vertical-align property is specified as one of the values listed below:

- Values for inline elements
  - Parent-relative values
    These values vertically align the element relative to its parent element:
    - baseline
      Aligns the baseline of the element with the baseline of its parent.
    - sub
      Aligns the baseline of the element with the subscript-baseline of its parent.
    - super
      Aligns the baseline of the element with the superscript-baseline of its parent.
    - text-top
      Aligns the top of the element with the top of the parent element's font.
    - text-bottom
      Aligns the bottom of the element with the bottom of the parent element's font.
    - middle
      Aligns the middle of the element with the baseline plus half the x-height of the parent.
    - `<length>`
      Aligns the baseline of the element to the given length above the baseline of its parent. A negative value is allowed.
    - `<percentage>`
      Aligns the baseline of the element to the given percentage above the baseline of its parent, with the value being a percentage of the line-height property. A negative value is allowed.
  - Line-relative values
    The following values vertically align the element relative to the entire line: - top
    Aligns the top of the element and its descendants with the top of the entire line. - bottom
    Aligns the bottom of the element and its descendants with the bottom of the entire line.
- Values for table cells
  - baseline (and sub, super, text-top, text-bottom, `<length>`, and `<percentage>`)
    Aligns the baseline of the cell with the baseline of all other cells in the row that are baseline-aligned.
  - top
    Aligns the top padding edge of the cell with the top of the row.
  - middle
    Centers the padding box of the cell within the row.
  - bottom
    Aligns the bottom padding edge of the cell with the bottom of the row.

### Text Decoration

The `text-decoration` property accepts the keyword values of **\*none**, **underline**, **overline** (adds a line over the top of the text), **line-through** (adds a line through words), **blink** (animates the text to make it flash on and off, however this is generally frowned upon, as it is considered rather annoying) and **inherit\***.
Multiple text-decoration values may be applied to an element at once by space-separating each keyword within the value.

### Text Indent

The `text-indent` property can be used to indent the first line of text within an element, as is commonly seen in printed publications. All common length values are available for this property. Positive values will indent text inward, while negative values will indent text outward.

### Text Shadow

The `text-shadow` property allows us to add a shadow or multiple shadows to text. The property generally takes four values: **offset-x, offset-y, blur radius and color**.
The text-shadow property here is casting a 30% opaque black shadow 3 pixels towards the right, 6 pixels down, and blurred 2 pixels off all `<p>` element text:

```
 p {
 text-shadow: 3px 6px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, .3);
 }
```

Using negative length values for the horizontal and vertical offsets allows us to move shadows toward the left and the top.
Multiple text shadows can also be chained together using comma-separated values, adding more than one shadow to the text.

#### Box Shadow

The `text-shadow` property places a shadow specifically on the text of an element. If we’d like to place a shadow on the element as a whole, we can use the `box-shadow` property.
The `box-shadow` property takes values for <u>**inset**, _offset-x_, _offset-y_, _blur-radius_, **spread-radius**, _color_</u>.
The **optional inset value at the beginning of the value** determines whether to place the shadow inside an element as opposed to outside the element.
The optional fourth length value, **spread-radius**, indicates the spread of a shadow. As a positive length value, the spread will expand the shadow larger than the size of the element it’s applied to, and as a negative length value the spread will shrink.

### Text Transform

Similar to the `font-variant` property, there is the text-transform property.
|Value|Result|
|:-----:|:------:|
|lowercase|"transform me"|
|uppercase|"TRANSFORM ME"|
|capitalize|"Transform Me"|
|initial|Use the default value|
|inherit|Use the `text-transform` value from the parent element|
|none|Default: Use the original text|

### Letter Spacing

**Kerning** is the term typographers use for the space between each letter. The `letter-spacing` property, we can adjust the space (or tracking) between the letters on a page. A positive length value will push letters farther apart from one another, while a negative length value will pull letters closer together. The keyword value _none_ will return the space between letters back to its normal size. Using a _<u>relative length value (em)</u>_ with the letter-spacing property will help ensure that we maintain the correct spacing between letters as the font-size of the text is changed.

The default gap between words is set by the typeface (often around 0.25em), and
it is unlikely that you would need to change this property regularly. <i><u>You may need to increase the kerning when your heading or sentence is all in uppercase.</u></i>

### Word Spacing

Much like the `letter-spacing` property, we can also adjust the space between words within an element using the `word-spacing` property.

## Citations & Quotes

- `<cite>`: Used to reference a creative work, author, or resource, the element must include either the title of the work, the author’s name, or a URL reference to the work.
- `<q>`: Used for short, inline quotations, dialogue or prose. By default, the browser will insert the proper **quotation marks** for us and will even change the quotation marks based on the language identified within the lang global attribute.
- `<blockquote>`: Used for longer external quotations. The `<blockquote>` is a block-level element that may have other block-level elements nested inside it, including headings and paragraphs. It can have the attribute `cite` to designate a source url.
- Both `<q>` and `<blockquote>` can use `cite` attribute to indicate the URL the quotation is from.

## Typeface Terminology

- Serif: Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs. In print, serif fonts were traditionally used for long passages of text because they were considered easier to read.
- Sans-Serif: Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design. Screens have a lower resolution than print. So, if the text is small, sans-serif fonts can be clearer to read.
- Monospace: Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.) Monospace fonts are commonly used for code because they align nicely, making the text easier to follow.
